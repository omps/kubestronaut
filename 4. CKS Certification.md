Certification Link: [Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/certified-kubernetes-security-specialist-cks)

Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) candidates must have taken and passed the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam **prior to attempting the CKS exam**.

**Who is it for?**  
A Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) is an accomplished Kubernetes practitioner (must be CKA certified) who has demonstrated competence on a broad range of best practices for securing container-based applications and Kubernetes platforms during build, deployment and runtime.

**What does CKS Demonstrate?**  
Obtaining a CKS demonstrates a candidate possesses the requisite abilities to secure container-based applications and Kubernetes platforms during build, deployment and runtime, and is qualified to perform these tasks in a professional setting.

**What is included?  
**2 hour duration  
Performance Based Exam  
Certification valid for 2 years  
Includes 12 month eligibility  
Includes one retake  
PDF Certificate and Digital Badge  
Exam Simulator


**Cluster Setup 15%**

Use Network security policies to restrict cluster level access  
Use CIS benchmark to review the security configuration of Kubernetes components (etcd, kubelet, kubedns, kubeapi)  
Properly set up Ingress with TLS  
Protect node metadata and endpoints  
Verify platform binaries before deploying  

**Cluster Hardening 15%**

Use Role Based Access Controls to minimize exposure  
Exercise caution in using service accounts e.g. disable defaults, minimize permissions on newly created ones  
Restrict access to Kubernetes API  
Upgrade Kubernetes to avoid vulnerabilities

**System Hardening 10%**

Minimize host OS footprint (reduce attack surface)  
Using least-privilege identity and access management  
Minimize external access to the network  
Appropriately use kernel hardening tools such as AppArmor, seccomp

**Minimize Microservice Vulnerabilities 20%**

Use appropriate pod security standards  
Manage Kubernetes secrets  
Understand and implement isolation techniques (multi-tenancy, sandboxed containers, etc.)  
Implement Pod-to-Pod encryption using Cilium

**Supply Chain Security 20%**

Minimize base image footprint  
Understand your supply chain (e.g. SBOM, CI/CD, artifact repositories)  
Secure your supply chain (permitted registries, sign and validate artifacts, etc.)  
Perform static analysis of user workloads and container images (e.g. Kubesec, KubeLinter)

**Monitoring, Logging and Runtime Security 20%**

Perform behavioral analytics to detect malicious activities  
Detect threats within physical infrastructure, apps, networks, data, users and workloads  
Investigate and identify phases of attack and bad actors within the environment  
Ensure immutability of containers at runtime  
Use Kubernetes audit logs to monitor access
