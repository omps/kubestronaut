# Notes sync
Notes are stored in windows home drive
kubestronaut home drive folder is the golden source of truth
Obsidian client uses the stored notes in user home area.
I am using WSL for syncing across
- google drive
- icloud (setup is pending) - i can use this just for storing notes, i cannot make changes in the icloud and sync back to obsidian home drive.
- I may need to setup another tool to sync back iclouddrive to windows home drive.
- I may need to first check all the files in all the places (google drive, icloud, c: drive, github) based on that need to define a sync strategy. everything sync back to home drive and then goes on to git.

TODO
- setup a cronjob to sync kubestronaut home drive folder to icloud
