>[!note] Important Note to consider before giving exam
1. Use Ctrl+Alt+W instead of Ctrl+W. ^[*(Ctrl+W is a keyboard shortcut that will close the current tab in Google Chrome.)*]
2. The Terminal (Terminal Emulator Application) is a Linux Terminal, to copy & paste within the Linux Terminal you need to use LINUX keyboard shortcuts: Copy = Ctrl+Shift+C Paste = Ctrl+Shift+V ^[(Or use the right-click context menu and select Copy or Paste)]
3. In other applications on the Remote Desktop (which is on a Linux Desktop), you'll want to use: Copy = Ctrl+C Paste = Ctrl+V
4. The locate cursor functionality has been assigned to the key combination CTRL+ALT+K. ^[You must complete each task in this exam on a designated `host`]    
5. An infobox at the start of each task provides you with instructions to `ssh` into the designated`host`.
6. Once you have completed a task, `exit` the `SSH` session to return to the base system (hostname `base`). *Nested ssh is not supported*
7. `hosts` can be reached via `ssh`, using a command such as the following: `ssh <nodename>`
8. You can assume elevated privileges on any `host` by issuing the following command: `sudo -i`
9. You can also use `sudo` to execute commands with elevated privileges at any time
10. For your convenience, all SSH hosts have the following additional command-line tools pre-installed and pre-configured:
    - `kubectl` with `k`alias and Bash autocompletion
    - `yq` for YAML processing
    - `curl` and `wget` for testing web services
    - `man` and man pages for further documentation
11. The base system (hostname `base`) does not have any of the above tools pre-installed as all tasks on this exam must be completed on a designated `SSH` host.
12. The CKA environment is currently running Kubernetes v1.33 The CKAD environment is currently running Kubernetes v1.34.
